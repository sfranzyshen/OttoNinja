## OttoNinja

This is the OttoNinja Web App Control Interface from the [Otto Web App Control](https://github.com/OttoDIY/OttoWebAppControl]) Project that has been expanded to be standalone and served from the esp8266 microcontroller.
This also requires a minimum of 1mb for the filesystem ... it supports wifi configurations for either station (STA) or access point (AP) modes.
